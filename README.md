# C++ Array Template Class

This project implements a generic `Array` class in C++ using templates. It supports a range of data types including integers, floats, characters, and custom objects. The class includes common operations such as:

- Populating and displaying array elements
- Displaying a specific index
- Sorting in ascending and descending order
- Reversing array elements
- Calculating the sum of numeric arrays

A custom `director` class is also included to demonstrate object handling in templates.
